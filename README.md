# Hand Sign Prediction using American Sign Language (ASL)

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict alphabetical characters from given hand signs using American Sign Language (ASL). The model aims to assist users who are unable to speak or listen by enabling them to communicate through hand signs. The model can also form sentences from a sequence of hand signs, providing a more comprehensive communication tool.

## Features

- **Alphabet Prediction**: Predicts individual alphabetical characters based on hand signs.
- **Sentence Formation**: Forms sentences from a sequence of hand signs.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed to assist users with speech or hearing impairments.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: 
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: 
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Pandas

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Harsh20042002/Hand-sign-Recognition-using-ASL.git
    cd hand-sign-prediction-asl
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```

2. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of images of hand signs representing the alphabetical characters in ASL. The dataset can be obtained from various online sources or created manually.

## Model Architecture

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **Input Layer**: Images of hand signs.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts features from the images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classifies the images into alphabetical characters.
- **Output Layer**: Predicted alphabetical character.

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

- **Input Layer**: Features extracted from hand sign images.
- **Hidden Layers**: Processes the features through several hidden layers.
- **Output Layer**: Predicted alphabetical character.
